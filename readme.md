# Welcome to SHREDDED STATS 

### Welcome to Shredded Stats! A convenient way to track all of your workout stats. We were tired of logging all our workouts  
### in a note on our phone so we created a solution.

### You can then create workouts. Name them, select the muscle group and input the amount of sets for the workout!

### You can then compile all of your routines into a workout. This will help prevent you from forgetting that one workout.

### After a routine is created, you can then log your workouts as stats. These stats will allow you to input data based on the
### routine you have created.

### -There is a bug right now that I am aware of so that would be the highest urgency task. 

### -After that, the first thing I work on for this project is to finish adding the update methods to Stats and Routines. 

### -The next I would like to include is a user function. It seemed really daunting in the beginning but now I am much  
### more comfortable with with the whole MEN stack. 

## Icebox features:  
### -Creating a score for users based on stats from the workout  
### -Have new stats populate the inputs with the stats from the last workout as a QOL feature
